# Accommodation-Management-System

This repository contains the code for the Accommodation Management System (AMS), a project designed to streamline and automate the management of student accommodation in schools. This project was developed as part of my final year individual project at university.

## Project Overview

The AMS is a web-based application, that is designed to assist staff in managing student accommodation. The system automates many of the mundane tasks involved in accommodation management, such as booking rooms, managing student details, and viewing room availability.

The system has been designed with an intuitive, user-friendly interface to ensure ease of use for staff members.
